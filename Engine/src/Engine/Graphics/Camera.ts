* @description defines the viewport bounds and perspective mul to be applied to a Scenegraph & its contents.
* @note because perspective style is propagated recursively through document node tree, the camera's div must be
* the parent of the scenegraph(s) it will render. This also means that if the user wants to render the same scene with
* multiple cameras, the original scenegraph must be duplicated for each additional camera. This is currently not supported
* by this project.
